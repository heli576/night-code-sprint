##FindMyDr
The proposed project is a smart appointment booking system that provides patients or any user an easy way of booking a doctor’s appointment online. This is a web based application that overcomes the issue of managing and booking appointments according to user’s choice or demands. The task sometimes becomes very tedious for the compounder or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the users as per their availability. Hence this project offers an effective solution where users can view various booking slots available and select the preferred date and time.
